          At Google we say, “Focus on the user and all else will follow.” We embrace that principle
          in our design by seeking to build experiences that surprise and enlighten our users in
          equal measure. This site is for exploring how we go about it. You can read our design
          guidelines, download assets and resources, meet our team, and learn about job and
          training opportunities.
